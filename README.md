# Algorithms and Design Fundamentals

## Project Goal

As a Software Engineer focused heavily on DevOps and SRE, my work often involves high-level architectural design and infrastructure optimization. Over time, the routine practice of core data structures and low-level algorithmic efficiency has naturally decreased.
This repository serves as my dedicated, hands-on environment for a focused refresher on computer science fundamentals. It is a personal effort to ensure I maintain a strong, well-rounded technical skillset by revisiting different areas.
The goal is continuous professional development: to bridge the gap between architectural systems design and the highly efficient, optimized code execution expected of a senior technical contributor.

### Areas:

1.  **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Mastering time and space complexity ($O(n), O(\log n)$, etc.) for optimal code execution.
2.  **Core Data Structures:** Implementing and understanding the trade-offs of structures like arrays, hash maps, trees, and graphs.
3.  **Algorithmic Patterns:** Practicing key techniques like two Pointers, sliding window, dynamic programming, and graph traversal.
4.  **System Design:** Capturing high-level design solutions (e.g., architecture diagrams, scaling considerations) for complex problems.

## Repository Structure

The code is organized by the core data structure or algorithmic pattern being practiced.
